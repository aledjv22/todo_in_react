# to-do list with React

My name is Alejandro DÃ­az, I created this repository with the aim of showing the world my practice in React and having a historical system of the various changes that were incorporated with each new learning about it.

The project is based on a list of tasks that allows the user to have a better management of their tasks knowing their status. It has a format for cell phones and computers. In it the 'LocalStorage', 'Effect', 'Hooks' and 'Context' were used.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploy the project by creating a new branch (gh-pages) uploading the files created by the `npm run build`, setting the github pages to display to all [project](https://aledjv22.github.io/todo_in_react/ "project") visitors.

## Upcoming changes

It is expected to implement a new function that allows you to enable the change of the project to a dark theme.
